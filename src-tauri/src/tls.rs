//! Process-wide rustls backend selection.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! `rustls 0.23` resolves a process-wide `CryptoProvider` lazily, and it can
//! only pick one from its own Cargo features. DataZen links **two** providers
//! into every build, so it has to make that choice itself:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ cargo tree -p datazen --edges normal,build -e features -i rustls@0.23.43
//! ├── rustls feature "aws-lc-rs"  <- reqwest (feature "rustls"), tokio-rustls (default features)
//! └── rustls feature "ring"       <- tauri-plugin-updater (feature "rustls-tls")
//! ```
//!
//! (Enabling a driver adds more `ring` requesters — `redis` via
//! `tls-rustls`, `mongodb` via `rustls-tls`, plus `sqlx`/`duckdb` — but the
//! production host already has both features with **no** driver enabled, so
//! this is not a driver-selection problem.)
//!
//! With both features compiled in, `CryptoProvider::from_crate_features()`
//! returns `None` and every **auto-detecting** `ClientConfig::builder()` panics
//! — the `.expect(..)` inside `get_default_or_install_from_crate_features()` in
//! `rustls-0.23/src/crypto/mod.rs`:
//!
//! ```text
//! Could not automatically determine the process-level CryptoProvider from
//! Rustls crate features. Call CryptoProvider::install_default() before this
//! point to select a provider manually, ...
//! ```
//!
//! ## This is a latent crash, not a startup crash
//!
//! Nothing on the `run()` / `run_mcp_stdio()` bootstrap path builds a
//! `ClientConfig`, so the process starts fine and blows up on the *first* use
//! of one of the three auto-detecting sites in the shipped binary:
//!
//! | site | reached by |
//! |------|-----------|
//! | `tunnel/http_proxy.rs::tls_connect` | an `https://` HTTP CONNECT tunnel |
//! | `tungstenite 0.26.2/src/tls.rs` (via `tokio-tungstenite`) | a `wss://` tunnel |
//! | `redis 0.27.6/src/connection.rs` (via `datazen-driver-redis`) | a `rediss://` connection |
//!
//! The rest of the graph is **not** uniformly indifferent, and the important
//! one is `reqwest`. `sqlx` (`sqlx-core-0.8.6/src/net/tls/tls_rustls.rs:107`)
//! and `mongodb` (`mongodb-3.8.0/src/runtime/tls_rustls.rs:86`) really do name
//! a provider, and `rustls-platform-verifier`'s `BuilderVerifierExt` inherits
//! one from the builder it is handed — but its other entry point,
//! `ConfigVerifierExt::with_platform_verifier`
//! (`rustls-platform-verifier-0.7.0/src/lib.rs:88`), calls the *auto-detecting*
//! `ClientConfig::builder()`. Nothing in this graph calls it, so it adds no
//! reachable panic here, but "this crate names a provider explicitly" is not
//! true of it.
//!
//! `reqwest` is the one that matters, and it is **not** unaffected:
//! `reqwest-0.13.4/src/async_impl/client.rs:719-721` reads
//! `CryptoProvider::get_default()` **first** and uses that provider whenever one
//! is installed, falling back to its own `aws-lc-rs` only when none is. So
//! whatever ends up in the process default is what every `reqwest` client in
//! the process uses — all the AI providers and all the HTTP-based drivers —
//! and it would switch over without a word. That is the reason the ordering
//! below is load-bearing rather than cosmetic.
//!
//! ## The rival installer
//!
//! `tauri-plugin-updater 2.10.1/src/updater.rs` installs **ring** when it finds
//! no default. That is a second, disagreeing proposal for the same
//! process-global slot, so idempotency alone is not the requirement: this
//! module has to be the *first* installer to run, and it has to say so when it
//! loses.

use std::sync::OnceLock;

/// Empty by design: the cell exists only to run the decision once per process,
/// and the outcome of that decision is reported through `tracing` at the time.
static PROVIDER: OnceLock<()> = OnceLock::new();

/// Install the process-wide rustls `CryptoProvider` if none is installed yet.
///
/// `aws-lc-rs` is the choice, and it is a choice rather than a fallback:
///
/// - it is rustls 0.23's **own** preferred provider, i.e. the one
///   `ClientConfig::builder()` would have picked on its own had only a single
///   provider feature been enabled, so this reproduces the intended behaviour
///   instead of overriding it;
/// - `tokio-rustls`'s default features and `reqwest`'s `rustls` feature both
///   enable `aws-lc-rs`, and those are the dominant TLS consumers here —
///   `reqwest` carries every AI provider and the HTTP-based drivers, and it
///   *adopts* the process default whenever one exists
///   (`reqwest-0.13.4/src/async_impl/client.rs:719-721`) rather than pinning
///   its own, so choosing `aws-lc-rs` here is what makes the process agree
///   with itself instead of holding two views of one slot.
///
/// ## Concurrency
///
/// `OnceLock::get_or_init` runs the closure at most once per process, blocks
/// every other caller until that one returns, and is **not** poisoned if the
/// closure unwinds — a later call simply retries. `std::sync::Once` would be
/// the wrong primitive here precisely because it *does* poison, turning a
/// single unlucky unwind into a permanent "Once instance has previously been
/// poisoned" panic on every subsequent call.
///
/// The closure performs no check-then-act: it calls `install_default()`
/// unconditionally and lets rustls' own compare-and-swap decide the winner.
/// That removes the time-of-check/time-of-use window a
/// `if get_default().is_none()` guard would leave between the read and the
/// install, and it is why N threads racing here can never panic: exactly one
/// gets `Ok(())`, the rest get the losing provider back as `Err` and the
/// process keeps a working default either way.
///
/// ## Ordering
///
/// Because `tauri-plugin-updater` competes for the same slot with a *different*
/// provider, being first is the whole defence. `main()` calls this before it
/// parses argv, so both entry points (GUI and `--mcp-stdio`) have it installed
/// before the Tauri builder — and therefore before the updater plugin — can run.
/// The tunnel construction sites call it again so that library/test embedders
/// that never go through `main()` are covered too.
///
/// None of that ordering rests on the sentence above. The updater installs
/// nothing from `Builder::build()` or from the plugin's `init()`: its `ring`
/// install sits inside `Updater::check()`
/// (`tauri-plugin-updater-2.10.1/src/updater.rs:446-448`), which the WebView
/// only reaches from `checkForUpdates()` — a user action, or the opt-in
/// `check_for_updates_on_startup` setting — long after `main()` and after the
/// builder has run. `tauri` carries a third copy of the same snippet at
/// `tauri-2.11.5/src/protocol/tauri.rs:44`, but it is `#[cfg(all(dev, mobile))]`
/// and is not compiled into a desktop build. `main()` going first is the
/// cheapest of these three guarantees, and it is the one that still holds if
/// either dependency moves.
///
/// Never panics. Note the `warn!` on the losing branch is only *observable*
/// once a `tracing_subscriber` is installed; when `main()` makes the call that
/// happens before logging is up, so in the shipped app the losing case is
/// silent and the signal exists for embedders that call this later.
