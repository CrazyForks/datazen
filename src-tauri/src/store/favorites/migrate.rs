//! One-time migration of `favorite_queries` rows into `.sql` files.
//!
//! Favorites used to live in `{appData}/history.sqlite`. Moving them to files
//! (plan §2.6) must not lose a single row, and the migration has to be safe to
//! interrupt: a laptop that sleeps mid-export, or a favorites root on a
//! read-only volume, must be recoverable without user action.
//!
//! ## Ordering
//!
//! 0. If `favorite_queries_legacy_v1` already exists, this database has run
//!    the export: stop. See [`migrate_legacy_favorites`] for why a live
//!    `favorite_queries` next to the archive must not trigger a re-export.
//! 1. Read every legacy row.
//! 2. Write one file per row, with a **deterministic** file name derived from
//!    the row itself.
//! 3. Only once every file is on disk, rename `favorite_queries` to its archive
//!    name and write the marker.
//!
//! Step 2 before step 3 is the whole safety argument. If the export dies half
//! way, the legacy table is untouched, so the next launch retries — and because
//! the names are derived from the row rather than freshly minted, a retry
//! rewrites the same paths instead of creating a second copy of everything.
//!
//! The archive (not a `DROP`) is the rollback: the original rows stay in the
//! original database, so the migration can be undone by renaming the table
//! back. `favorite_queries` as a *live* table is what retires here; the bytes
//! it held are not thrown away.
