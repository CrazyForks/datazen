/**
 * The navigator's ARIA, in one place.
 *
 * This used to be spelled out eleven times inside `NavigatorTreeRow` — once per
 * row variant — and every spelling was a place where "is this row a branch?"
 * could be answered differently. Two rules are worth naming, because both look
 * like omissions and are not:
 *
 * 1. **`aria-level` is the announced depth, not the painted one.** Under a
 *    search the builder shifts `levelDepth` one rung up (the group header that
 *    used to sit between them is gone), while `paddingLeft` keeps following
 *    `depth`. The two numbers are deliberately *not* harmonised: the indent is
 *    what the eye follows, the level is what the screen reader announces, and
 *    `ariaLevelOf` is the only conversion between them.
 * 2. **A leaf has no `aria-expanded` at all.** Not `false` — absent. A
 *    `false` on a row with no child list tells assistive tech the node is
 *    collapsed and therefore activatable, which is a lie about a table.
 *    "Does this row own a child list" is row-model knowledge, so the answer
 *    lives here rather than being defaulted by the shared shell.
 *
 * `empty-group` and `no-connections` are *decoration*: a hint block, not a
 * tree item, and they get no role and no level at all.

 * question two different ways: `navigatorRowAria` wrote `aria-expanded` for
 * every `namespace-node` it saw, while `isNavigatorBranch` — which the shell
 * uses to decide the same thing for navigation — read `isLeaf`. A namespace
 * leaf therefore announced itself as a collapsed disclosure of a list it does
 * not have, which is precisely the lie rule 2 above exists to prevent.
 *
 * Deriving the announcement from {@link isNavigatorBranch} rather than from a
 * second copy of the leaf test makes the disagreement unrepresentable. Every
 * variant that can be a branch or a leaf routes through here, so a future one
 * is correct by construction instead of by a fourth spelling of the rule.
