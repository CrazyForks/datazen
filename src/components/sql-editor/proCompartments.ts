/**
 * Privileged-extension (EP) plumbing for the SQL editor: the compartment
 * registry, the atomic batch reconfiguration, the generic settings bag, and the
 * two generic hooks (`createExtraExtensions` / `createExtraKeymap`).
 *
 * Why this module exists
 * ----------------------
 * The editor used to carry a hard-coded six-slot compartment set and rewire it
 * with six independent `view.dispatch` calls, one per slot. That has two costs:
 *
 *  1. **Non-atomic.** Each dispatch is a separate transaction, so an observer
 *     (an update listener, a decoration pass, a key handler) can observe a
 *     frame in which some Pro compartments are configured and others are not.
 *  2. **Closed set.** A privileged extension could not add a capability of its
 *     own without a host release, because the payload shape was a six-key
 *     literal type.
 *
 * `ProCompartmentPayload` is now an open `Record<string, Extension[]>` that is
 * traversed rather than destructured, so an extension that registers its own
 * compartment id before mount gets a first-class, independently reconfigurable
 * slot — and every reconfiguration lands in exactly one transaction.
 *
 * Multi-instance note: the registry is a module-level singleton and the
 * `Compartment` instances are shared by every editor instance, but
 * CodeMirror keeps a *per-state* `compartment → content` map, so a
 * reconfigure dispatched to one view can never reach another. That invariant is
 * pinned by a dedicated test rather than assumed.
