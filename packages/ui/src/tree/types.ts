/**
 * The row contract every ARIA tree in DataZen shares.
 *
 * Two independent trees paint `role="tree"` rows — the host's connection
 * navigator (`src/windows/connection/navigator/`) and the Redis key browser
 * (`packages/drivers/redis/ui/key-browser/`) — and each used to derive a row's
 * hierarchy, indent and announced level from private arithmetic that had
 * already drifted from the other's. These types are the one place that
 * arithmetic is written down: `geometry.ts` turns them into numbers,
 * `navigation.ts` answers the structural questions a flat pre-order row list
 * raises, and neither module knows anything about React, the DOM, or a driver.
 *
 * The shapes are deliberately *capabilities* rather than one wide row type.
 * Both trees model rows as discriminated unions whose "does this row own
 * children" answer is a `type` / `kind` fork rather than a field
 * (`namespace-node` carries `isLeaf`, but `db-loading` and `no-connections`
 * carry nothing at all), so the structural helpers take an injected
 * `isBranch` predicate — exactly like `nextNavigableIndex` has always taken an
 * injected `isNavigable` — instead of pretending a union is flat. A future row
 * model that does carry `hasChildren` gets the default and passes nothing.
