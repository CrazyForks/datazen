/**
 * Row R1 of the key-tree column header (PRD §3.2 屏 B 左列).
 *
 * This row is *resident*: the search-scope segment control used to sit in the
 * database sidebar, which the host hides whenever it renders its own navigator
 * tree (`hideSidebar`) — so in the normal layout the user could never switch
 * between key / value / all search. R1 owns the segment control, the loaded-vs-total
 * counter and the action group that the tree's selection feeds.
 *
 * Counter semantics (PRD §3.2 R1 + I-4): `已加载 N / 共 M` while the scan cursor is
 * exhausted, `N+` while it is not — an unfinished scan never presents a partial
 * subset as a total.
 *
 * R2 search and R3 grouping rows mount as `children` so the header stays one
 * bordered block instead of sibling divs in the workbench.
