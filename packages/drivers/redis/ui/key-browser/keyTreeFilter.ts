/**
 * Client-side application of the R2 pattern to the *tree* rows
 * (redis-tree-ui-BUG-001).
 *
 * `list_children` takes no pattern (its options are `sep` / `noTtlOnly` /
 * `keyType`; a Rust-side contract change is outside this track), so the pattern
 * the flat `scan_keys` list already honours has to be applied to the tree here.
 * Everything in this module is a pure function over already-loaded rows, which
 * is what makes the glob semantics, the breadcrumb back-fill and the "nothing
 * matched" result testable without a DOM.
 *
 * The matcher is a **port of Redis' own `stringmatchlen_impl`** (`src/util.c`,
 * 7.2, `nocase = 0`) — byte-level alphabet, `[...]` classes with `^` negation,
 * `-` ranges, `\` escapes, the unterminated-class fallback, and a `?` that
 * consumes one *byte*. That fidelity is the whole point (redis-tree-ui-BUG-003):
 * a regex-shaped approximation is *almost* the same dialect, and "almost" is what
 * let the list view show three keys for `*[0-9]` while the tree asserted
 * `no-match` about the very same keys. `patternHasGlob` already treats `[` and
 * `\` as glob characters and sends them to the server verbatim, so the product
 * invites class expressions — both views must then mean the same thing by them.
 *
 * Redis matches on the **UTF-8 bytes** of a key, so names are encoded before
 * comparison and a `?` over a multi-byte character consumes one byte, exactly as
 * it does server-side.
 *
 * Visibility forks on `row.kind` — never on whether a `key` field happens to be
 * present. A child-level leaf row's `entry.key` is the *full* key the server
 * returned (Rust `split_children` keeps it absolute) and a folder row's `path`
 * is the full prefix including its trailing separator, so both are matched
 * against the same pattern string with the same meaning.
 *
 * Known limitation, by ruling: the pattern is applied to the *loaded* row set
 * only. A level whose scan has not finished holds keys the filter has never
 * seen, so `(n+)` counts stay server-side and `redis.tree.filterUnloaded` names
 * the gap. Full-keyset matching belongs to R / Wave 4.
