/**
 * Per-database key count for the KV slots, read through `db_sizes`.
 *
 * `KvSlotState` (contract F-1) deliberately carries **no** key count: every
 * getter returns a scalar the workbench publishes, and the tree's own `DBSIZE`
 * is not one of them (`getLoadedCount()` is the *loaded* subset, a different
 * fact). PRD §3.4 wants `52 keys` in both the context bar and the status bar, so
 * each reads the driver command the rest of the driver already uses for counts.
 *
 * **Two slots, one round trip** (the same rule `useKeyObjectInfo`'s
 * `sharedKeyObjectInfo` records as redis-kvbar-ui-BUG-002). The context bar and
 * the status bar render in different React subtrees with no common parent, so
 * without merging they would each issue their own `db_sizes` — and that command
 * is `SELECT` + `DBSIZE` per database, i.e. 32 round trips on a 16-db server.
 * Doubling it on every db switch is exactly the cost this module exists to
 * avoid.
 *
 * The in-flight map is keyed **weakly by the panel relay** because that object
 * *is* the panel's identity for these slots (`useKvWorkspaceSlots` hands the
 * same `getKvSlotState(panelId)` to every slot, and the host prunes it when the
 * panel closes). Values are unsettled promises only, deleted the moment they
 * settle: this is an in-flight merge, never a cache — a finished read must not
 * be handed to a slot that mounts later, or a reopened panel would paint a
 * stale count (contract F-2 rejected driver-side caches for this reason).
