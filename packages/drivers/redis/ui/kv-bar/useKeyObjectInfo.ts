/**
 * One-shot read of `key_object_info` for a single key, for the KV slots.
 *
 * Both the key-props sidebar and the bottom status bar show facts about the
 * selected key, and neither may call back into the workbench (contract F-2
 * makes the relay write-only for the driver and read-only for the slots), so
 * each slot reads the command itself. The read is deliberately *not* polled:
 * `OBJECT IDLETIME` / `MEMORY USAGE` are cheap but they are still two round
 * trips per call (`SELECT` + pipeline) on a key the user may click straight
 * past, so the trigger is selection, not a timer.
 *
 * **State ownership** (redis-kvbar-ui-BUG-001): every read is tagged with the key
 * it was issued for, and {@link publishRead} publishes a read only to that key.
 * Consequences, structural rather than "remember to clear":
 * - a fast key→key click cannot paint the previous key's type / size / TTL,
 *   because the attributes die on the *render* that moves the selection, before
 *   the effect for the new key has even run;
 * - while a read is in flight the caller has no known facts, so the slots render
 *   nothing instead of a half-truth (§3.4 “不渲染，不是渲染 0”);
 * - a reply for a superseded read is discarded where it lands, so it can neither
 *   paint another key's row nor clear the current one's `loading` marker.
 *
 * **Two slots, one round trip** (redis-kvbar-ui-BUG-002): with the drawer open the
 * status bar and the sidebar want the same read at the same instant, and they sit
 * in different React subtrees with no driver-side common parent. They now join the
 * *same in-flight request* — see {@link sharedKeyObjectInfo}, which is scoped to
 * the panel relay and holds nothing once the command settles. A shared *value*
 * cache is deliberately not the answer: a cache only pays off if it outlives the
 * component that filled it, and that is exactly the driver-side module singleton
 * contract F-2 rejected.
