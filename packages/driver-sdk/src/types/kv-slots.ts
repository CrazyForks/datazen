/**
 * Per-panel KV state, created and owned by the **host** and handed to every
 * in-panel slot *and* to the panel's connection view (`ConnectionViewProps.kvSlotState`).
 *
 * Why a host-owned relay instead of a driver module singleton: the workbench
 * (which knows the selected key and the unsaved-draft flag) and the toolbar /
 * status-bar / sidebar slots render in three different React subtrees, and the
 * host decides when the panel — and therefore this state — dies. A driver-side
 * module cache keyed by session would outlive the panel.
 *
 * The getters plus `subscribe` are intentionally
 * `useSyncExternalStore`-shaped so a slot subscribes to exactly the field it
 * renders (`useSyncExternalStore(state.subscribe, state.getSelectedKey)`).
 * The host does **not** subscribe on the render path: selection changes are far
 * too frequent to re-render the whole workspace, which is why the selected key
 * is *not* also passed as a plain prop.
 *
 * **Every getter returns a scalar or `null` — no exceptions.** A getter that
 * builds an array/object per call hands `useSyncExternalStore` a new snapshot
 * every render, which is an infinite re-render loop; that is a ruling, not a
 * style preference (W3-A §1.1). Anything aggregate therefore arrives as the
 * *count* or *label* a slot can render on its own (`getLoadedCount()`,
 * `getSelectionCount()`), and the rich collection (the selected keys themselves)
 * stays inside the driver workbench that owns it.
 *
 * Setters are the driver's write side: the key tree publishes what it knows
 * (scan progress, selection size) and the editors publish writes. A setter that
 * receives the value it already holds **must not** notify subscribers — the tree
 * reports on every scroll/scan tick, and a chatty relay would re-render every
 * slot continuously. The host implementation enforces that; see `src/lib/kvSlotState.ts`.
 *
 * Widen-only rule: the five original members keep their names and signatures —
 * Wave-2 driver slots (`ui/kv-bar/**`) are already built against them.
