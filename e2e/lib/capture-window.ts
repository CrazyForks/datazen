/**
 * Window geometry for release-gallery captures.
 *
 * Why this exists: the WebDriver screenshot is taken at the window's *backing*
 * pixel size, so a maximized window on a Retina display yields 2880x1648 —
 * true 2x pixels, the same density as the best legacy gallery images. Pinning
 * the window from the driver instead (`browser.setWindowSize`, or a `set_size`
 * IPC) is honoured 1:1 in CSS points and silently discards devicePixelRatio,
 * which is how the gallery ended up holding 14 different sizes.
 *
 * So: maximize, never resize. `ensureMaximized()` is idempotent and cheap — it
 * only acts when the window is not already maximized, which makes it safe to
 * call before every capture.
 *
 * One trap worth knowing: `set_size` without a label applies to whichever
 * window the driver is attached to, and `switchToWindow` does not reliably
 * re-point the Tauri WebDriver at the child window. A "child window" resize
 * can therefore land on the main window and shrink it. Anything that resizes a
 * window must re-maximize the main window afterwards — hence `ensureMaximized`
 * being cheap enough to call unconditionally.
