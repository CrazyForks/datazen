/**
 * Static guard for the invariant asserted in mutation-check-pane-focus.mjs:
 * no statement in its `finally` block may throw.
 *
 * Why the invariant needs a machine check. The block's promise is that a failure
 * there degrades the report instead of escaping the module — an escaping throw
 * prints a bare stack and makes node force exit 1 regardless of process.exitCode,
 * which is EXIT.UNCOVERED, and it does so *before* the exit-code fold at the
 * bottom, discarding every exitReason pushed so far. That promise is invisible to
 * review: a bare `unlinkSync(backup);` looks exactly as innocent as a guarded one.
 * It was in fact bare, unchanged since before that harness was extended, and the
 * first proof of the restore path found a *different* bare call in the same block.
 *
 * What it checks, and why each part is there:
 *   1. every `finally` block in the file, and there is at least one. Taking only
 *      the first one in the file was a bug in an earlier version of this checker:
 *      a longer, compliant `try/finally` in a helper above the real block
 *      satisfied the check on its behalf, and a bare `unlinkSync` in the actual
 *      restore block passed with "ok" and exit 0. All of them are checked now,
 *      and each finding names the block it came from so a decoy cannot mask the
 *      real one;
 *   2. every node:fs call in them sits inside a try/catch;
 *   3. none contains a `throw` statement. This is what makes (2) sufficient
 *      rather than merely necessary: a guarded call inside a try whose catch
 *      re-throws is protected by nothing, and depth counting alone would call
 *      that safe.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-restore-block-guards.mjs           check the harness
 *   node scripts/check-restore-block-guards.mjs <file>    check some other file
 *   node scripts/check-restore-block-guards.mjs --selftest prove the check itself
 *   pnpm check:restore-guards                             the same, by name
 *
 * Exit 0 = invariant holds. Exit 1 = it does not, and every offending line is
 * printed. Exit 2 = the file could not be read or does not have the expected
 * shape. The selftest exits 0 only if the check FAILS on the fixtures it is
 * supposed to fail on AND passes on the real file; a check that cannot report a
 * failure is worse than no check, so that is the point of `--selftest`. It also
 * asserts the fixture inputs are pairwise distinct, since two identical inputs
 * test one path and inflate the count — the "depth bug" fixture used to be a
 * byte-for-byte copy of another one and was counted twice.
 *
 * It is a gate, not a courtesy. `pnpm typecheck` runs it first, ahead of the tsc
 * programs, and CI runs `pnpm typecheck` (.github/workflows/ci.yml), so a bare
 * call in the restore block fails the build. It was previously wired to nothing
 * at all, which made it worth exactly as much as remembering to run it; keeping
 * it in the typecheck chain costs about 35 ms per run, of which roughly 23 ms is
 * node startup, against tsc passes that take seconds. Putting it in
 * tsconfig.pack-ep.json's `files` list remains about its *types* only, and is not
 * what makes it a gate.
 *
 * Known limits, named because a tool that cannot see them is worse than one that
 * does not check:
 *   - `strip()` blanks comments and quoted strings but not regular-expression
 *     literals, so a regex containing a quote blanks the rest of the file and the
 *     run ends in "no `finally` block found" (exit 2). It refuses loudly rather
 *     than passing wrongly; tell/slash is deliberately not special-cased.
 *   - a call is identified by name, not by what it resolves to: a helper named
 *     `rethrow(` is correctly not read as a throw statement, but equally a helper
 *     that *does* re-throw is invisible. It reads the file, it does not run it.
 *   - a `try { … } catch { … }` written on one line is handled, because the brace
 *     stack is a separate pass; but the pairing pass looks ahead for a `catch`,
 *     so an unterminated `try` at end of file is read as having none.
 *
 * The `files` list of tsconfig.pack-ep.json still cannot force a *future* new .mjs
 * under scripts/ to be registered there: `files` plus `include: []` is a
 * whitelist, not a discovery set. That is a property of that program, not
 * something this file can fix from the inside.
