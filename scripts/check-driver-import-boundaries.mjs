/**
 * Driver ↔ host import boundary guard (Wave 4, track `import-guard`).
 *
 * Waves 1–3 cleared every reference from driver frontends back into host code
 * (`docs/development/driver-api-dependency-boundary.md` §2.1). That kind of
 * decoupling is trivially re-introduced by one autocomplete keystroke in a new
 * MR, so this script turns the written contract into a build-time gate.
 *
 * Rules (see §2.1.2 / §2.4.2 / §2.2 of the contract):
 *
 *   R1  Driver packages must not reference host `src/**`.
 *       Scans **every string-literal specifier** in `packages/drivers/**`
 *       (`.ts/.tsx/.js/.jsx/.mjs/.cjs`) — plain `import`, `export … from`,
 *       dynamic `import()`, `vi.mock()` / `vi.doMock()`, `require()` and any
 *       helper that takes a module path all end up as string literals, so
 *       nothing depends on the keyword in front of them. Matching only
 *       `from '…'` — the way the earlier `grep -rn "from '\.\./.*src/"`
 *       baseline was collected — silently misses the mock/require shapes
 *       (that is exactly how 8 `vi.mock('<rel>/src/hooks/useI18n')` violations
 *       stayed invisible during Wave 2). A literal is a violation when it is
 *       relative and — once resolved against the importing file — lands inside
 *       the host `src/` directory. Bare package specifiers are the sanctioned
 *       surface and are left to the bundler/TypeScript.
 *
 *   R2  Only the host may call `setLocale()` (§2.4.2).
 *       Scans `packages/**` — except `packages/ui/src/i18n.ts`, which owns the
 *       single i18n runtime (§2.4.1) and its own unit test, which has to call
 *       it (see `R2_FILE_CARVEOUTS`). Comment text, string literals and
 *       type/interface member declarations (`setLocale(locale: string): void;`)
 *       are not calls and never count.
 *
 *   R3  Host code must not reach into driver internals (symmetry, §2.2 row 4).
 *       Scans `src/**` for relative specifiers resolving into
 *       `packages/drivers/**`, skipping the gitignored codegen registries
 *       `src/extensions/generated*.ts` — importing drivers there is the
 *       sanctioned mechanism.
 *       **Advisory (non-blocking)**: the current baseline still carries real
 *       findings (host test harnesses + `DocumentConnectionView.tsx`); they are
 *       reported for the record and left to the coordinator's ruling rather
 *       than being papered over with new exemptions. Flip `blocking` in
 *       `RULES.R3` once that ruling lands.
 *
 *   R4  The shared design system must stay host-free and runtime-free.
 *       Scans **every string literal** in `packages/ui/**`: no
 *       `@tauri-apps/*` plugin, no `zustand`, and no relative climb into the
 *       host `src/**`, a driver package or a sibling DataZen package.
 *       `@datazen/ui` is bundled by the host, by every driver and by every
 *       extension, several of which run without a Tauri webview — a host
 *       runtime imported from a primitive breaks all of them at once, and the
 *       existing rules could not see it: R1 only covers `packages/drivers/**`,
 *       R2 only looks for `setLocale()`, R3 only looks at `src/**`. This rule
 *       is what the `PathInput` → `@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog` import tripped.
 *
 * Exemptions live in `ALLOWLIST` below: exact `(rule, file, specifier)` triples
 * with a reason and the milestone that owns them — no directory or glob
 * wildcards. Entries that stop matching (file gone, or violation fixed) are
 * reported as expired exemptions so the list cannot silently rot.
 *
 * Blocking scope (BUG-008 ruling): a rule with `blocking: true` only fails the
 * gate for **source this repository tracks**. A local full checkout may carry
 * gitignored external trees — git-driver clones under `packages/drivers/<id>/`
 * (`.gitignore` `/packages/drivers/*` + per-builtin un-ignores) and Pro EPs
 * under `packages/pro-extensions/` (each its own git repo). Those are not this
 * repo's code, so findings there are downgraded to **advisory** (still listed
 * file:line, counted, but exit code stays 0) and flagged as external drift to
 * be fixed in that repository — never absorbed into `ALLOWLIST`. Classification
 * runs `git check-ignore` **per violating file only** (single-digit calls),
 * never on the walk hot path. If git is unavailable or errors, the file is
 * treated as tracked (fail-safe: the gate stays strict).
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 clean (external-tree advisories do not count) · 1 blocking
 * violation(s) or expired exemption(s) · 2 the guard could not scan anything
 * (wrong repo root / broken checkout).
