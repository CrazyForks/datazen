/**
 * i18n-key-collision-check.mjs — host ↔ driver translation-key ownership guard.
 *
 * WHY (measured, not assumed — see the numbers in the closing report):
 * the host and every driver feed the SAME translation registry
 * (`@datazen/ui` `registerTranslations`, which merges with `Object.assign`).
 * Nothing in that engine has namespaces: a key is a flat string, and on a
 * duplicate the LAST registration silently wins. `i18n-sync-check.mjs` only
 * compares one key set across languages within a scope — it never compares two
 * scopes against each other, so a cross-scope duplicate is invisible to it.
 *
 * That is exactly how the host's `mongo.*` set (src/locales/<loc>/connection.ts,
 * consumed by 19 changed lines in src/windows/connection/DocumentConnectionView.tsx
 * holding 21 `t()` calls over 15 distinct keys — lines 369 and 604 carry two calls
 * each) and the mongodb driver pack's `mongo.*` set (packages/drivers/mongodb/locales/*)
 * ended up defining the same 15 keys. The driver pack self-registers second
 * (host registers at src/locales/index.ts module load; the pack registers via
 * packages/drivers/<id>/ui/meta.ts → locales/index.ts, imported later through
 * src/extensions/generated.ts), so 15/15 host values were overwritten and 9/15
 * English strings the host actually renders were replaced by the driver's
 * wording ('Insert document' → 'Insert', '{count} document(s)' → '{count} docs').
 * The two sides serve different consumers — the host renders the document
 * connection view, the driver ships the meta record and a JSON-command builder
 * — so merging the wording is not a fix either. The only correct fix is
 * separate namespaces, which this script then keeps separate.
 *
 * THE RULE: a translation key must have exactly one owner. That has to hold
 * across every participating namespace, not just the host/driver axis: driver
 * packs self-register into the same flat registry, so a key defined by two
 * different drivers is the same class of silent-overwrite hazard. Two axes are
 * therefore checked: host × driver, and driver × driver. On this tree the
 * second axis is latent coverage, not a live conflict (mongodb 15 keys ×
 * redis 417 keys intersect in 0).
 *
 * WHAT THIS GUARD DOES NOT DO — registration order. It is a pure key-set
 * comparison and has no model of import order at all, so when there is no
 * duplicate it says nothing about who would win. That blindness is not
 * hypothetical: measured on the pre-fix tree through the real pipeline,
 * driverWins=15 and hostWins=0 — the host value was never rendered even once.
 * If two owners ever need the same key with no rename, that is an engine
 * change (namespaced registration), not something this script can catch.
 *
 * The OK line deliberately prints how many host keys and how many keys per
 * driver pack were actually read. "0 collisions" is only meaningful next to
 * non-zero input counts — a scanner that silently scanned nothing also reports
 * zero. Two empty-scan shapes are refused with exit 2 rather than 0: nothing
 * scanned at all, and a HALF-empty scan where a discovered pack contributed
 * zero keys and so was never actually compared against anything.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/i18n-key-collision-check.mjs
 *   node scripts/i18n-key-collision-check.mjs --root=<dir>
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 no collision · 1 at least one collision · 2 scan incomplete.
