/**
 * [tester] Mutation check for the BUG-001 pane-focus single-writer rule.
 *
 * `focusedPaneIdByPanel` has exactly one writer in production: `syncPaneFocus`
 * (plus the two whole-state literals at module scope and in `reset`). Reading
 * the code cannot tell you whether an action actually routes through it — only a
 * mutation can. This script reverts each focus-touching action in
 * `src/stores/panelStore.ts` to its pre-BUG-001 shape and requires the **pane
 * suite** to go red: the 10 files in `TESTS` below, run together. Nothing here
 * looks at one file — a cell is RED when the whole `TESTS` run exits non-zero, so
 * a mutation that only some *other* file in that list can see still counts as
 * caught. "This file went red" is not a criterion this script evaluates.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/mutation-check-pane-focus.mjs [--keep-going]
 *   `--keep-going` is accepted and is also the default: the loop never stops at
 *   the first uncovered mutation, it reports every one of them.
 *
 * ## Is this a gate? Half of one, on purpose — read this before adding a CI step.
 *
 * TYPECHECKED: yes. This file is listed in `files` of `tsconfig.pack-ep.json`,
 *   so `pnpm typecheck` (and CI's "TypeScript typecheck" step) type-checks it. It
 *   is a program member, not a `// @ts-check` pragma, so deleting or renaming the
 *   file turns the gate red with TS6053 instead of quietly going unchecked.
 *
 * EXECUTED BY CI: **no, and deliberately not.** `grep -rn mutation-check-pane-focus
 *   .github/ package.json` returns nothing: no workflow, no npm script, no wrapper
 *   names or runs it. It is a manual tool you run when you touch the pane focus
 *   rule. The reason is measured, not guessed: a full run is 16 sequential vitest
 *   invocations (1 baseline + 15 cells), **78 s wall clock** on an otherwise idle
 *   machine. Each cell is a *separate* `vitest run` of the whole 10-file list
 *   rather than a rerun of a subset, because a mutation is only meaningful
 *   against the full pane suite. That does not parallelise, it does not share a
 *   transform cache across cells, and it lands on top of an already-slow CI job;
 *   on a shared runner, or on a machine with the rest of the suite running, the
 *   same run measured 13-15 min in practice. Spending that on every commit to
 *   re-derive "15/15" — a result that only changes when panelStore.ts or a pane
 *   test changes — is a bad trade. Run it by hand when you change either side.
 *
 * Do not add a CI step for it without re-measuring on the runner you intend to
 * use, and do not "fix" the 78 s by narrowing `TESTS`: the suite-level criterion
 * is the whole point of this harness.
 *
 * The restore is **anchored to git, not to a disk re-read**. `PRISTINE` is always
 * `git show HEAD:src/stores/panelStore.ts`, and every mutated file is built from
 * it — never from whatever happens to be on disk. Two guards follow from that,
 * and both are load-bearing; an earlier version had neither, and was measured to
 * be silently wrong on both:
 *
 *   - **INTERFERENCE** — if the file on disk already differs from HEAD *before*
 *     the first injection, this run would not be measuring the committed state.
 *     It says so on stdout AND stderr, refuses to run, and exits 4 without
 *     touching the file.
 *   - **VOID** — if after a mutation the file on disk is not byte-identical to
 *     what this run wrote, that mutation's result cannot be read at all: a
 *     write-back that silently failed used to be printed as `RED`. It is recorded
 *     as VOID and exits 5.
 *
 * That earlier version snapshotted the file from disk, restored the snapshot,
 * and then compared the file with **that same snapshot**: a tautology, blind to
 * git, which can only ever prove "the file equals what I just wrote". It printed
 * `restored byte-for-byte: true` even when the working tree had already been
 * drifted by someone else — measured: one pure-comment line added to
 * `panelStore.ts`, harness run to completion, the drifted bytes written back and
 * a clean restore reported, exit 0.
 *
 * The write-back target is the committed file, which on any run that got past the
 * interference assertion is byte-identical to what was found on disk (that
 * equality is exactly what the assertion proves). The single exception is at
 * `restoreTarget` below and is deliberately **not** a restore — read it before
 * "simplifying" the two arms into one. `<path>.mutation-backup` holds the startup
 * bytes. It is deleted when the run finishes having put the store back, and it is
 * deliberately left on disk in every other case — including a run that exits 0,
 * because the deletion itself can fail on a read-only directory. So a backup
 * still on disk after a run is the expected shape, not a surprise to chase.
 * No mutation is ever committed.
 *
 * Exit codes — 0 is the only value that means "this measurement is trustworthy":
 *   0 clean · 1 uncovered · 2 baseline not green · 3 write-back verification
 *   failed · 4 pre-injection interference with HEAD · 5 a mutation was VOID ·
 *   6 lost control of the store file (the loop threw, or the restore failed) ·
 *   7 the safety backup could not be written, so nothing was mutated at all.
 * If several apply, the highest wins, and **every** condition found is printed.
 * 6 sits above the rest on purpose: a tree left holding an injected mutation
 * voids every number in the run, so it must not be summarised as "1 uncovered".
 * 7 is above 6 only as a tiebreak — they cannot co-occur, because 7 exits before
 * the first mutation and 6 needs a mutation to have happened.
 *
 * `PANE_MUTATION_FAULT` is a debug-only fault injector (off by default), the
 * counterpart of `NEW_WT_FORCE_FAIL` in scripts/new-feature-worktree.sh. Each
 * value fires once and produces exactly one reportable condition:
 *   write-back — corrupt the file right after the harness writes it back, so the
 *               VOID guard is exercised by a real external write.
 *   mid-run    — make the file read-only with a mutation on disk, so the restore
 *               fails. This is the LOST_CONTROL path that used to leave the
 *               injection in the tree behind a bare stack.
 *   restore    — make the file read-only only for the final restore, leaving the
 *               15 cells to complete, so the two LOST_CONTROL causes are
 *               separately observable.
 *   backup     — make the store's *directory* read-only, which stops the safety
 *               backup being written while leaving every rewrite of the file
 *               itself working. This is the NO_SAFETY_NET refusal, and the only
 *               value that needs a directory: a read-only FILE cannot express it.
 *               A read-only directory is not expressible by the two values above
 *               either, and pointing them at the directory does not make them
 *               stricter — it deletes the fault. Measured, on a scratch dir:
 *               dir 555 / file 644 lets an overwrite through and refuses only
 *               create+unlink; file 444 / dir 755 refuses the overwrite. So the
 *               file-scoped injectors work (their write fails, visibly, exit 6)
 *               but can only ever reach faults that break writing the FILE, and
 *               this one breaks nothing until the run is already over.
 *
 * `--testTimeout=30000` is passed deliberately: several tests here drive a
 * never-settling query stream, and a busy machine must not turn CPU contention
 * into a false RED. Every mutation below is expected to be caught by a specific
 * named assertion, not by a timeout.
