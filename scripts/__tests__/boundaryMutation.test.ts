/**
 * @vitest-environment node
 *
 * Self-healing of the probe lock and the probe sweep.
 *
 * A `mkdir` lock normally outlives its holder: SIGKILL, an OOM kill or a closed
 * terminal run no `finally`, so the directory stays, nothing holds it, and every
 * later run waits out the full timeout before failing — from a directory under
 * `node_modules/`, which `git status` never shows. The only available defence is
 * that the *next* run notices and recovers, which is what these cases pin.
 *
 * Each case drives `withProbeLockAt` against a private lock under a temp dir
 * rather than the shared one: a test that planted a fake lock at the shared path
 * would break the mutual exclusion every other guard test relies on.
