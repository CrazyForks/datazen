 * be green for the wrong reason (wrong directory, wrong root, walk skipped).

 * How long a lock with no readable owner file is given before it is taken over.
 *
 * The owner file is written synchronously right after the `mkdir` wins, so a
 * missing one means either a dead run (the common case: a kill between the two
 * statements, or a write that failed) or the microsecond-wide window of a live
 * holder that has not written it yet. Treating "no owner" as stale outright
 * would let a second process into the critical section in exactly that window,
 * which is the collision the lock exists to prevent, so a grace period is
 * required rather than optional.
 *
 * It only has to outlast the mkdir-to-write gap, not a whole critical section
 * (a full-tree boundaries scan measures ~0.32s in process and ~0.42s as a CLI
 * here; ~3.4s was observed under concurrent load and is not reproducible solo),
 * because the owner file is present for the entire rest of the run.
 *
 * That clause is a precondition, not a general truth, and the grace has to be
 * sized against it rather than against the critical section. While a holder is
 * inside the write window it has no owner file at all: `readLockOwnerPid`
 * returns null, the pid check below is unreachable, and this grace is the only
 * thing between that live holder and a second process. The gap measures p50
 * 0.12ms and a worst case of 17ms over two runs of 20k samples, so the shipped
 * 2s is ~118x the worst observation. (The *median* would make it look like
 * four orders of magnitude, which is how this number used to be described; the
 * median is not the statistic a safety margin should be sized on.) The 500ms
 * floor the suite pins is the same measurement at ~29x. It is deliberately under
 * the 5s per-test budget, so recovering from a killed run stays inside one test
 * instead of turning into a test timeout.
 *
 * Scope, because the constant and the branches below are one unit: the ownerless
 * branch in {@link lockIsStale} is what reads this value, and the fifth
 * parameter of {@link withProbeLockAt} exists only so the cases can shrink it
 * instead of spending 2s each. All of it is test infrastructure: no non-test
 * file imports it, and neither guard CLI, `packages/ui` nor `src/` is touched
 * by it, so nothing decided here can reach host product code. It does run as
 * part of the host suite — `vitest.config.ts` includes the `.test.{ts,mjs}`
 * files under `scripts/__tests__` — so these cases *are* host tests.

 * It is 10x *above* the 60s wait, not below it, and that is deliberate: pid
