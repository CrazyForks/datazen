// Scope: what the packer rewrites, and what the shipped artifact must then prove
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Packaging itself — args, staging, signing, layout — is in `pack-ep.test.ts`.
// These four blocks sit on the other side of that seam: the import rewriter, the
// shared-module registry it is allowed to rewrite, the asymmetry probe that keeps
// the registry honest, and the host-key invariant the built `.dzx` has to satisfy.
// Split out for size, not for subject: the seam is clean, so a reader of either file
// does not have to hold the other half in mind.
//
// The rationale for why none of this reads `packages/pro-extensions/` is written
// out once, in `pack-ep.test.ts`, and applies to the whole subject. In short: four
// cases in that file used to read the Pro checkout, two of them behind bare
// `if (!existsSync) return` guards, so in a Pro-less checkout they reported green
// for a check that never ran. Each was either a Host-owned rule (kept, re-pointed at
// a synthetic EP) or a Pro-owned one (moved to the Pro repo's own `verify-host-pin.mjs`,
// which runs on every Pro CI and has no path by which the Pro checkout is absent).

 * into one rule. The case below closes that hole from the Host side **without
 * reading the extension's checkout**: it derives the admitted set from the
 * Host's own `package.json` — every `@codemirror/*` the Host depends on that the
 * Host table does not publish — and asserts the rewriter hard-fails each one.
 *
 * The assertion about the extension's own `vite.config.ts` (that it still carries
 * the wide `/^@codemirror\//` rule, and that the range is still strictly wider
 * than the allow-list) reads the extension's build config, so it now lives in
